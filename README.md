<p>FeraDroid Engine (simply FDE) - an All-in-One ultimate optimizer for <b>all</b> devices on Android OS. <b>No settings/customization</b> and rest 'headache' - all parameters are <b>individual</b> for EVERY device depending on its hardware/software characteristics. All parameters are <i>very balanced</i> - you may gain performance without increase of power consumption AND reduce power consumption without losing performance. FDE is totally compatible with very wide range of devices and Android versions.<br></p>

<h3 align="center"><strong>Features</strong></h3>
<p>FDE - <b>very universal</b> Android OS optimizer. Very wide-range settings of OS and Linux kernel are configured, still being cross-platform utility, maximally compatible with all devices. This means that it doesn't have any dirty hacks/hard codes and 3rd part binaries (except busybox) & config files. FDE applies configurations depending on its hardware and software, so that in the end every device is configured <b>individually</b>.</p><p>New <i>unique</i> method of execution - all required FDE components are loaded directly to RAM and executed from there. System partitions are remounted RW only once while installation. This means <b>high speed</b> (the worst RAM will have at least ~500MB/s of I/O speed), <b>no power consumption</b> (no NAND memory I/O occurs) and <b>security</b> (system partitions are in read-only state). Also new-gen FDE is synced with OS boot process - so tweaks will be applied in correct time. All system partitions are trimmed and checked for errors after every OS boot with FDE onboard. Universal installer automatically detects what ROOT-method you use and how to autostart. Finally, FDE is not only about optimization. It's also about security and <i>feature-enabler</i>.</p><p align="center">See compacted list of most included features <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=79092323&postcount=517"><b>HERE</b></a>.<br></p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Magisk-Modules-Repo/FDE/master/ai.png"></p>
<p>As you may notice from the name "FDE.AI" - can tell us that it has a <b>real</b> <code>AI inside</code>. AI will learn how do you use your device, check out current usage scenario and adapt some system parameters real time to give you best usage experience.

<h3 align="center"><strong>Why to optimize?</strong></h3>
<p>First of all <b>to make you happy with your device</b>, to make it live longer & be snappy. Another reason is garbage. WTF? Yes. There is a world problem of e-garbage utilization, especially electronic devices & their toxic stuff like batteries..etc.. I'm not against progress - I'm against the selling politics of corporations, which add features slowly, to make people buy them. I'd say OKAY if it wasn't harmful, but in fact Africa became a toxic garbage continent - they need somewhere to put retarded e-devices & that's sad. It costs them cheaper to move toxic garbage to another country, rather then properly utilize it. You may say, how FDE can help with that, are you mad bro? Well, I hope that if you install FDE on your device, you'd use it for longer time, because of all optimizations. So that it will make you happy & you won't change it too frequently, in fact possibly reducing the amount of e-garbage. Thanks.<br></p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>Installation:</strong></h3>
<p align="center"><i>WARNING! Don't use any other All-in-One tweakers or things may get much worse! I warned you!</i><br></p>
<p><b>- Make a backup just in case something goes wrong.</b></p>
<p><b>- Download latest FDE .zip and install it via recovery OR Magisk manager.</b></p>
<p><b>- After OS boot, if FDE worked OK you will get a <i>toast alert</i>, double vibration and a log file <i>/sdcard/fde.txt</i> will be created.</b><br></p>
<p>When installing new version of FDE - previous version will be automatically removed. For showing toast alerts small app called "ShowMessage" will be automatically installed - it doesn't use any OS permissions and if you don't like FDE toast alerts you can uninstall this app.<br></p>
